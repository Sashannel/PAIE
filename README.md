PAIE --- Pablo's AI Ecosystem

My first attempt at making an AI from scratch, with no framework, only using numpy and pygame.
Although highly unrealistic, I believe it is a fun project and surely did teach me a lot about
neural networks and graphics in python. I also want to make a simpler version
of this to fit inside of a Ti 83 python calculator.
